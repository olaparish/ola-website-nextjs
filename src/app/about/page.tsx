        The Story of Our Lady Queen of Africa (OLA) Parish, Bolgatanga
      </h2>
      <p className="mt-7.5">
        Our Lady Queen of Africa Parish, affectionately known as OLA Parish, has
        grown from humble beginnings into one of the most vibrant and
        spiritually dynamic Catholic communities in the Navrongo-Bolgatanga
        Diocese. The Parish's story is one of faith, perseverance, service, and
        collective dedication.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-8">The Humble Beginnings</h3>
      <p className="mt-7.5">
        The roots of OLA Parish trace back to a small Christian prayer and choir
        group that met at Azika’s House in Tindonmolgo. This close-knit
        community faced many challenges in their mission to grow and spread the
        Gospel. However, their unwavering dedication, along with the support of
        Fr. Richard Achambault (then Vicar General), and the leadership of Madam
        Paulina Awuni and Mr. Stephen Anafo, led to a steady rise in membership,
        unity, and enthusiasm.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-7.5">
        Moved by their commitment, Fr. Achambault initiated steps toward
        establishing a new parish—an idea aligned with the vision of the then
        Bishop, Most Rev. Lucas Abadamloora of blessed memory.

      <h3 className="mt-8">Formal Establishment and Early Growth</h3>
      <p className="mt-7.5">
        In June 1995, an interim committee was formed to oversee the creation of
        the parish. Their tireless efforts culminated in the celebration of the
        first Mass on <strong>Holy Trinity Sunday, 11th June 1995</strong>. Due
        to rain, services moved from tents to Zamse Senior High/Technical
        School’s premises.

      <p className="mt-7.5">
        By July 30, 1995, Bishop Abadamloora visited the young parish, planting
        the first tree and confirming over 200 faithful—marking a major
        spiritual milestone.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-7.5">
        The name <strong>Our Lady Queen of Africa</strong> was chosen after much
        debate and a vote, prevailing over the alternative,
        <em>Holy Trinity Parish</em>.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-8">Geographical Reach and Outstations</h3>
      <p className="mt-7.5">
        The central parish community was defined to include Damweo, Pobaga,
        Tindonmolgo, Tindonsobligo, Kunbangre, and Kalbeo/Basengo, with
        outstations established in Sherigu, Balungu, Pwalungu, Winkogo, and
        Arigu. Gambibgo and Kalbeo/Basengo became outstations after the parish
        was officially created.

      <h3 className="mt-8">Development of Parish Infrastructure</h3>
      <p className="mt-7.5">
        Under the guidance of the Spiritan fathers—particularly Rev. Fr. Patrice
        Gasser—the parish saw remarkable growth in infrastructure. A Parish
        House was constructed in 1997 through Fr. Patrice’s leadership and the
        generosity of both local and international supporters.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-7.5">
        In 1999, work began on the <strong>Multi-Purpose Hall</strong>, which
        was used for Mass, weddings, and events before completion. A severe
        storm in 2000 caused significant damage, but the community rallied with
        support from donors, and the hall was rebuilt.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-7.5">
        Fr. Patrice, known for his tireless service, led the construction of
        churches in Balungu, Pusu-Namongo, Gambibgo, and Sherigu, and
        established two Mission Houses in OLA and Fumbisi.

      <h3 className="mt-8">Education and Youth Empowerment</h3>
      <p className="mt-7.5">
        In 2003, thanks to support from Jersey Overseas Aid and Fr. Kuha Indyer,
        the <strong>OLA Vocational Centre</strong> was established. It trained
        many youth in trades, helping them become self-sufficient.
        Unfortunately, the school is currently dormant due to a lack of tutors.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-7.5">
        The <strong>OLA School Complex</strong>, a significant educational
        initiative, was spearheaded by Mr. George Philip Afulang in 2010 and
        supported by GETFund. It opened in 2011 with 245 pupils and now hosts
        over 425 students. It has already achieved notable academic and
        extracurricular success.

        The Parish Education Committee continues to push improvements such as a
        JHS block, crèche, better water systems, and classroom upgrades.

      "The Mass Servers Association (Altar Servers) plays a critical role in the liturgical life of OLA Parish. Composed mostly of young boys and girls, they assist the priest at the altar during Mass and other religious ceremonies. Their service adds dignity and smooth flow to the worship.",
      "Training is rigorous and continuous. New servers are taught the names and uses of liturgical vessels, vestments, and the structure of the Mass. In Bolgatanga, the servers are known for their precision and reverence, moving with grace and attentiveness around the sanctuary.",
      "The association is also a vocational ground. Many priests in the diocese began their journey as altar servers. The proximity to the sacred mysteries inspires a desire in many to dedicate their lives to God. The parish priest often mentors the servers, guiding them in their spiritual growth.",
      "Discipline and punctuality are core values. Servers are expected to arrive early for Mass to prepare the altar and themselves. This training in responsibility serves them well in their academic and personal lives.",
      "Beyond the altar, the Mass Servers engage in sports and social activities. They have a football team that competes with other societies, fostering camaraderie and team spirit. The association provides a wholesome environment for young people to grow in faith and friendship."

      "The Ushers Ministry in OLA Parish is the face of hospitality. They are the first people parishioners and visitors encounter when they enter the church. Their warm smiles and helpful guidance set the tone for the liturgical celebration. In Bolgatanga, they are dedicated to making everyone feel welcome and comfortable.",
      "Their primary duty is to maintain order during Mass. They help people find seats, organize the offertory procession, and ensure a smooth flow during Communion. Their vigilant presence minimizes distractions and allows the congregation to focus on worship.",
      "Ushers also care for the church environment. They often stay behind after Mass to ensure the pews are tidy and lost items are secured. They assist in the distribution of parish bulletins and other materials, acting as a communication link between the clergy and the laity.",
      "Training in conflict resolution and emergency response is part of their preparation. They are equipped to handle medical emergencies or security situations that may arise during large gatherings. This readiness ensures the safety of the congregation.",
      "Spiritually, ushers are reminded that they are doorkeepers in the house of the Lord. They begin their duties with prayer and strive to serve with humility and patience. Their ministry is seen as a direct service to God by serving His people."

      "The Lectors Ministry is charged with the proclamation of the Word of God during liturgical celebrations. In OLA Parish, lectors are carefully selected and trained to read the scriptures with clarity, understanding, and conviction. They believe that when they read, God himself speaks to his people.",
      "Preparation is key for every lector. They meet weekly to study the upcoming Sunday readings, discussing the historical context and theological meaning. This deep dive into scripture ensures that they proclaim the message effectively, not just as words on a page, but as a living truth.",
      "Lectors in Bolgatanga are also encouraged to be students of the Bible. They often lead Bible study groups in the parish, helping others to understand and love the scriptures. Their ministry extends beyond the ambo into the daily lives of the parishioners.",
      "The ministry is open to both men and women, young and old, who have a gift for public speaking and a love for God's word. Junior lectors are also trained to read during children's masses, ensuring a succession of capable proclaimers.",
      "Spiritual retreats are held regularly to renew their zeal. Lectors pray for the grace to live out what they proclaim, striving to be 'doers of the word and not hearers only.' Their reverent service enriches the liturgy and feeds the spiritual hunger of the congregation."

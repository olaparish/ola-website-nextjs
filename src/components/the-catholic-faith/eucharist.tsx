          The Eucharist is the center of the Catholic Church because Jesus
          Christ is the center of the Catholic life and worship. The Church
          proclaims, as it has for almost 2,000 years, that the Eucharist is the
          body, blood, soul and divinity of Jesus Christ himself. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the celebration of the Eucharist, bread and wine become the Body
          and Blood of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit and the
          instrumentality of the priest. The whole Christ is truly present -
          body, blood, soul, and divinity - under the appearances of bread and
          wine, the glorified Christ who rose from the dead. This is what the
          Church means when she speaks of the &quot;Real Presence&quot; of
          Christ in the Eucharist. 
        </p>

          The Lord Jesus, on the night before he suffered on the cross, shared
          one last meal with his disciples. During this meal our Savior
          instituted the sacrament of his Body and Blood. He did this in order
          to perpetuate the sacrifice of the Cross throughout the ages and to
          entrust to the Church a memorial of his death and resurrection.

          Jesus gives himself to us in the Eucharist as spiritual nourishment
          because he loves us. By eating the Body and drinking the Blood of
          Christ in the Eucharist, we become united to the person of Christ
          through his humanity. &quot;Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood
          remains in me and I in him&quot; (John 6:56). In being united to the
          humanity of Christ, we are at the same time united to his divinity.
          Our mortal and corruptible natures are transformed by being joined to
          the source of life.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          The transformed bread and wine are truly the Body and Blood of Christ
          and are not merely symbols. When Christ said “This is my body” and
          “This is my blood,” the bread and wine are transubstantiated. Though
          the bread and wine appear the same to our human faculties, they are
          actually the real body and blood of Jesus.

          By his Real Presence in the Eucharist Christ fulfils his promise to be
          with us &quot;always, until the end of the age&quot; (Mt 28:20). As
          St. Thomas Aquinas wrote, &quot;It is the law of friendship that
          friends should live together. . . . Christ has not left us without his
          bodily presence in this our pilgrimage, but he joins us to himself in
          this sacrament in the reality of his body and blood&quot; ( Summa
          Theologiae, III q. 75, a. 1). With this gift of Christ&apos;s presence
          in our midst, the Church is truly blessed. As Jesus told his
          disciples, referring to his presence among them, &quot;Amen, I say to
          you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but
          did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it&quot;
          (Mt 13:17). In the Eucharist the Church both receives the gift of
          Jesus Christ and gives grateful thanks to God for such a blessing.
          This thanksgiving is the only proper response, for through this gift
          of himself in the celebration of the Eucharist under the appearances
          of bread and wine Christ gives us the gift of eternal life.{" "}
